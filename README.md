## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Language:** R
- **Libraries:** `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `ggplot2`
- **Data Sources:**  
  - `Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv`  
  - `Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv`

## 🔍 Analysis Overview

1. Standardized column names across both datasets
2. Merged 2019 and 2020 Q1 data
3. Cleaned ride timestamps and calculated ride duration
4. Extracted date-based features (weekday, month)
5. Compared member vs. casual usage patterns via:
   - Ride frequency by day
   - Average ride length
   - Behavior trends over time

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Members** ride more consistently during weekdays (commute-based behavior)
- **Casual riders** ride more often on weekends and take **longer trips**
- Marketing should focus on converting casuals with leisure/weekend-oriented campaigns

---

## ✅ Final Output

- Full code in `analysis.R` is clean reproducable, and version-controlled
- Visualizations created in `ggplot2` are included in the keynote presentation
- All work was done using open-source tools on macOs and RStudio Cloud
